## 2. Introduction

This document outlines the **technical design and implementation strategy** for the **Microlending Platform** described in the Functional Requirements Document (FRD).

The system enables borrowers to request small loans and lenders to fund them, while enforcing credit evaluation, repayment tracking, and compliance reporting.

## 3. System Architecture

### **3.1 Overview**

The system follows a **three-tier architecture**:

| Layer                  | Description                                                            | Components                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Presentation Layer** | User-facing web interface for borrowers, lenders, and admins.          | HTML/CSS/JS frontend                  |
| **Application Layer**  | Business logic for loan processing, scoring, payments, and compliance. | FastAPI (Python)                      |
| **Data Layer**         | Persistent relational storage for structured financial and user data.  | PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway |

All layers communicate via RESTful APIs secured with JWT authentication.

## 4. Data Model

The data model is designed for **referential integrity**, **normalized structure**, and **auditability**.
Each entity follows a clear ownership and foreign key hierarchy to maintain consistency across borrower, lender, and transaction records.

### **4.1 Core Tables**

| Entity                          | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `UserAccount`                   | Stores user identity and credentials.               |
| `UserRole` / `UserAccountRole`  | Defines role-based access.                          |
| `Institution`                   | Represents financial or lending institutions.       |
| `UserProfile`                   | Holds borrower demographics and credit information. |
| `KYCVerification`               | Captures verification results for compliance.       |
| `LoanApplication`               | Tracks borrower loan requests and risk decisions.   |
| `LoanProduct`                   | Defines loan offerings by institutions.             |
| `Loan`                          | Represents active funded loans.                     |
| `Payment` / `RepaymentSchedule` | Tracks repayments and outstanding balances.         |
| `P2PLoanRequest` / `P2POffer`   | Manages peer-to-peer loan postings.                 |
| `Notification`                  | Logs outbound user communications.                  |
| `AuditLog`                      | Records every user or system action for compliance. |

### **4.2 Normalization and Integrity**

* **Normalization Level:** 3rd Normal Form (3NF)

  * Prevents duplication across entities (e.g., users vs. institutions).
* **Foreign Keys:** Enforced between user, loan, and payment tables.
* **Referential Integrity:** Cascading deletes for dependent records.
* **Indexing:**

  * `CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON UserAccount(email);`
  * `CREATE INDEX idx_loan_status ON Loan(status);`
  * `CREATE INDEX idx_payment_loan_id ON Payment(loan_id);`
* **Data Types:**

  * `UUID` for primary keys
  * `JSONB` for flexible metadata fields (e.g., fees, audit data)
  * `TIMESTAMP` for lifecycle events

## 7. Security Approach

| Area                         | Technique                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**           | JWT-based token issuance on login                        |
| **Authorization**            | Role-based access (Borrower, Lender, Admin, Compliance)  |
| **Data Protection**          | Password hashing (bcrypt/SHA256), TLS encryption         |
| **SQL Injection Prevention** | Parameterized queries & ORM input validation             |
| **Audit Logging**            | Track all CRUD and authentication actions                |
| **Compliance**               | Adheres to KYC/AML requirements with secure data storage |

## 8. Entitlements and Role Mapping

| Role                   | Accessible Functions                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Borrower**           | Apply for loans, view repayment status, send messages    |
| **Lender**             | Fund loans, view investments, withdraw balance           |
| **Administrator**      | Manage users, approve loans, generate system reports     |
| **Compliance Officer** | View audit trails, export reports, view flagged accounts |

All entitlements are enforced via middleware intercepting JWT claims before controller execution.

## 9. Interface Design

| Interface                    | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Interface (Frontend)** | Lightweight HTML/JS dashboard for end users                |
| **Admin Console**            | Role-based admin dashboard with data tables and filters    |
| **API Interface**            | JSON-based API for integrations and mobile extensions      |
| **CLI (optional)**           | Developer or DevOps tools for migrations, logs, or testing |

Each view layer interacts with the FastAPI backend using secured REST endpoints.

## 10. Scalability Considerations

| Area                       | Strategy                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Database Scaling**       | Vertical scaling via Railway Postgres tiers, read replicas for analytics |
| **Application Scaling**    | Horizontal scaling via Railway auto-scaling instances                    |
| **Caching**                | Redis layer for frequent lookups (e.g., user sessions, exchange rates)   |
| **Load Balancing**         | Railway-managed load balancing for multiple backend pods                 |
| **Data Sharding (Future)** | Partition loans/payments by region or institution for distributed writes |

---

## 11. Performance Optimization

* Index frequent query columns (`email`, `status`, `loan_id`).
* Use database connection pooling to reduce latency.
* Cache static configurations (currencies, rates).
* Optimize SELECT queries with joins instead of subqueries.
* Asynchronous I/O via FastAPI for concurrent requests.

## 12. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fraud or abuse**          | KYC verification, admin approval of lenders               |
| **Data breach**             | Encryption at rest + TLS, RBAC, least privilege DB access |
| **Duplicate payments**      | Transactional idempotency keys                            |
| **Performance degradation** | Index tuning, Redis caching, async processing             |
| **Service downtime**        | Health checks and Railway auto-restarts                   |

---

## 13. Testing Strategy

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI/CD**          | Automated pipeline (build â†’ test â†’ deploy) via GitHub Actions |
| **Hosting**        | Railway container deployment                                  |
| **Monitoring**     | Structured logging (JSON), Railway metrics, alert hooks       |
| **Error Tracking** | Logged via centralized service (e.g., Sentry)                 |
| **Metrics**        | API latency, DB health, active users, error rates             |
